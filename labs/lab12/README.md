# Lab 12 – Capstone Demo & Reflection

## Overview
Culminate the lab sequence with capstone demos where students showcase reinforcement learning solutions in simulation or on NAO hardware. Emphasis is placed on communication, reproducibility, and reflective analysis.

## Learning Objectives
- Synthesize concepts from the entire lab sequence into a coherent project.
- Communicate design decisions, evaluation metrics, and results effectively.
- Reflect on challenges, ethical considerations, and future extensions.

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Labs 01–11, with a project concept approved by instructors.
- Access to required hardware or simulation environments for final demonstrations.

## Pre-Lab Preparation
- Draft a project proposal outlining goals, methodology, and success criteria.
- Prepare slides or a storyboard for the demo, including contingency plans if hardware access fails.

## In-Lab Activities
1. Present project progress, focusing on RL methodology, experimentation, and results.
2. Run live demos or recorded simulations, inviting peer feedback.
3. Participate in a retrospective discussion on lessons learned and open research questions.

## Post-Lab Deliverables
- Final presentation slides and/or recorded demo linked from the lab folder.
- Reflective essay (1–2 pages) connecting lab experiences to future research or applications.
- Updated repository documentation so others can reproduce the project setup.

## Resources
- Instructor-provided rubric outlining evaluation criteria for demos, reports, and reflections.
- Optional templates for slide decks, demo scripts, and reflection prompts.
