# Lab 01 – Orientation & Tooling

## Overview
Kick off the reinforcement learning lab sequence by aligning on goals, tooling, and expectations. Students will set up the shared Python environment, explore the repository structure, and identify how course assets connect across labs.

## Learning Objectives
- Summarize the 12-lab journey and associated deliverables.
- Configure a reproducible Python 3.10+ environment with Jupyter and core RL packages.
- Validate access to Git, notebooks, and reference materials.

## Prerequisites
- Basic familiarity with Python scripting and package management.
- Ability to run commands in a terminal (macOS, Linux, or WSL recommended).

## Pre-Lab Preparation
- Review the introductory slide deck in [`old content/Lec/intro_RL.pdf`](../../old%20content/Lec/intro_RL.pdf) for context on RL vocabulary and applications.
- Skim the legacy notebook [`old content/ALL_WEEKS_V5 - Student.ipynb`](../../old%20content/ALL_WEEKS_V5%20-%20Student.ipynb) to understand how topics were previously sequenced.

## In-Lab Activities
1. Clone or pull the latest course repository and inspect the `labs/` folder layout.
2. Create and activate the recommended Python environment (e.g., `conda`, `venv`). Install packages such as `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `gymnasium`, and `torch`.
3. Launch Jupyter Lab/Notebook and run a provided `lab01_environment_check.ipynb` starter to confirm package versions and GPU availability (if relevant).
4. Document any setup issues and solutions for future cohorts.

## Post-Lab Deliverables
- Completed environment check notebook with package version outputs.
- Short reflection (3–5 sentences) describing an RL application area that interests you and why.

## Resources
- [`old content/notepad.txt`](../../old%20content/notepad.txt) for quick reminders on environment tips gathered from prior offerings.
- Suggested installation guides for conda or pip (instructor provided).
