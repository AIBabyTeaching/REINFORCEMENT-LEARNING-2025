# Lab 02 – Probability & Simulation Warm-Up

## Overview
Refresh foundational probability intuition through simulation exercises that prepare students for Markov decision processes and stochastic reasoning in later labs.

## Learning Objectives
- Implement simple stochastic processes in Python (coin flips, random walks).
- Compute empirical statistics and compare them with analytical expectations.
- Visualize convergence behavior and discuss randomness in RL contexts.

## Prerequisites
- Comfort with Python loops, lists, and plotting libraries (`matplotlib` or `seaborn`).
- Prior exposure to basic probability (mean, variance, distributions).

## Pre-Lab Preparation
- Read a short probability primer chosen by the instructor (e.g., MIT OCW notes or Khan Academy review).
- Revisit any undergraduate probability handouts provided locally; focus on expectation and variance definitions.

## In-Lab Activities
1. Implement a biased coin flip simulator that estimates empirical probability of heads vs. theoretical probability.
2. Build a 1D random-walk generator and track position distributions over time.
3. Visualize simulation results with histograms and line plots; discuss law of large numbers and variance.
4. Extend the simulation to a simple gambler’s ruin scenario for extra practice.

## Post-Lab Deliverables
- Notebook containing simulation code, plots, and concise commentary for each experiment.
- Summary paragraph describing key takeaways about randomness and sample size.

## Resources
- [Introduction to RL slides](../../old%20content/Lec/intro_RL.pdf) for context on how randomness appears in RL problems.
- Matplotlib and NumPy quick-start references (instructor curated) for students needing refresher support.
