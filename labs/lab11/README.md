# Lab 11 – Learning-Driven NAO Behaviors

## Overview
Bridge reinforcement learning policies with NAO robot behaviors. Students will deploy small state-space policies to the simulator (and physical robot if available), iterating on control loops informed by RL methods.

## Learning Objectives
- Adapt previously trained policies for NAO-friendly state and action spaces.
- Integrate sensor feedback loops into NAO scripts.
- Evaluate performance in simulation vs. hardware, documenting discrepancies.

## Prerequisites
- Successful completion of Lab 10’s setup and baseline scripts.
- Availability of a trained policy (tabular or neural) for adaptation.

## Pre-Lab Preparation
- Revisit [`old content/NAO_LAB_REBIRTH.pdf`](../../old%20content/NAO_LAB_REBIRTH.pdf) sections on behavior design and safety.
- Review relevant control examples from [`old content/ALL_WEEKS_V5 - Student.ipynb`](../../old%20content/ALL_WEEKS_V5%20-%20Student.ipynb).

## In-Lab Activities
1. Define a manageable NAO task (e.g., line following, posture stabilization, simple gesture sequencing).
2. Map RL state features to NAO sensor readings; discretize or normalize as required.
3. Deploy the policy to the simulator, collect logs, and adjust reward structures if needed.
4. Test on a real NAO robot when available, noting latency, safety constraints, and differences from simulation.

## Post-Lab Deliverables
- Code package containing policy implementation, NAO interface scripts, and configuration files.
- Lab report summarizing deployment process, observations, and open issues for hardware trials.

## Resources
- [`old content/howto.txt`](../../old%20content/howto.txt) for troubleshooting connection and environment issues.
- Instructor guidance on NAO safety procedures and lab access protocols.
